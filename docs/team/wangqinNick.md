## Overview
Repository Assistant with a Versatile Interface (ra.VI) is a desktop app for managing tasks, deadlines, and timetable, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI). It is written in Java and is built to run on Java 11 on Linux, Mac and Windows machines.

## My contributions
### Features implemented for Individual GUI Team Project:

* **New Feature**: Added the Graphical User Interface to the project
    * What it does: Allows user to have more intuitive concepts about the modules and related tasks.
    * Justification: The GUI is done by myself, thus due to the limited of time and human resources, it could only do limited features.
    * Highlights: 1. Different kinds of pop up windows and notifications are added.
                  2. The GUI is implemented with the console parts (console screen and console).
    * In-depth contribution:
        * Created a MainStage for the basic view.
        * Besides the MainStage, different kinds of pop-up components will be shown when the user clicks some buttons.
        * Add different kinds of interactions. For example, when the user hangs the mouse over a section, some windows will also be shown.

* **New Feature**: Added Directory System feature
    * What it does: The Directory System treats all the modules as directories. 
    * Justification: It follows the UNIX style. 
    * Highlights: 1. The directory level hierarchy is 'Root -> Module -> Task'
        * In-depth contribution:
            * Users could traverse through modules and root by using Change Directory command.
            * The traversing is facilitated by the traverse stack. This stack is used to store the level of directories.

* **New Feature**: Traverse previous commands feature.
    * What it does: Use the Up/Down arrow on the keyboard to traverse previous input commands in the GUI.
    * Justification: Users (students) would like to input a previous command. Like our terminal or CMD, the UP/DOWN arrow on the keyboard is used to traverse.
    * Highlights: 1. Add the event listener to catch the key press action.
        * In-depth contribution:
            * Add a CommandManager class to manage the history of all commands.

### Features implemented for Team CLI Team Project:

* **New Feature**: Added Edit task feature [#44](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T09-2/tp/pull/44)
    * What it does: Allows users (students) to edit existing tasks.
    * Justification: Users (students) may make some mistakes when adding tasks, like entering the wrong task description. This feature allows them to edit the task description.
    * Highlights: N.A.
    
* **New Feature**: Added Undo feature [#77](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T09-2/tp/pull/77)
    * What it does: Recover the previous operation.
    * Justification: The undo command could only recover the previous data-changed operations. The User could undo as many times as he wants. 
    * Highlights: 1. All commands are classified into "Edit", "Info" types.
                  2. Add the State class to save the copy of all data after user input "Data-Changed" operations.
                  3. Add the State Manager class to manage the saving states.
        * In-depth contribution:
            * Add encoder function to encoder the Module and Task objects to Json strings when saving.
            * Add decoder function to decode the Json strings back to Module and Task objects when loading.

* **New Feature**: Module Loader feature [#28](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T09-2/tp/pull/28)
    * What it does: Allow the program load all module information when it starts.
    * Justification: The module information is provided by NUSMODS.
    * Highlights: Add the IoManager class to load modules when the program starts.
        * In-depth contribution:
                * Parse the Json file (module information) to the Module object.
                * Once all modules are parsed, save them to the HashMap that stores the moduleMap.

    
* **New Feature**: Added Undo feature [#77](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T09-2/tp/pull/77)
    * What it does: Recover the previous operation.
    * Justification: The undo command could only recover the previous data-changed operations. The User could undo as many times as he wants. 
    * Highlights: 1. All commands are classified into "Edit", "Info" types.
                  2. Add the State class to save the copy of all data after user input "Data-Changed" operations.
                  3. Add the State Manager class to manage the saving states.
        * In-depth contribution:
            * Add encoder function to encoder the Module and Task objects to Json strings when saving.
            * Add decoder function to decode the Json strings back to Module and Task objects when loading.
