#### CS2113T Project: ra.VI
Repository Assistant with a Versatile Interface (ra.VI) is a desktop app for NUS freshmen, helping them manage tasks, deadlines, and their timetable. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI).
#### My contributions
#### Features implemented:
* **New Feature**: Added the timetable feature [#101](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T09-2/tp/pull/101) [#118](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T09-2/tp/pull/118)
    * What it does: Allows the user to manage their lessons in their timetable. This includes adding, deleting, viewing and filtering.
    * Highlights: This feature was challenging due to the Time element. Therefore, we had to be very careful during our implementation, creating a robust data structure to handle the timetable.
    * In-depth contribution:
        * Implemented the parsing of the timetable commands.
        * Implemented the `TimeTableManager` to handle the lessons from the timetable.
        * Implemented the commands to add and delete lessons from the timetable.
