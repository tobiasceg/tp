## Introduction

Repository Assistant with a Versatile Interface (ra.VI) is a desktop app for managing tasks, deadlines, and timetable, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI). If you can type fast, ra.VI can manage your tasks and timetable faster than traditional GUI apps.

This user guide aims to provide you with a clear documentation of ra.VI's features. In addition, the quick start guide provides an start-to-end setup process to begin tracking your tasks, modules, and lessons with ra.VI!

---

### Product Overview

ra.VI is targeted at you - the NUS freshman. As a freshman, there are many documents and new procedures that you must get familiar with. This may be daunting for you but ra.VI will provide you with the assistance you need.

By helping you keep track of your tasks and deadlines, you will be able to keep on top of deadlines.
Moreover, the timetable feature helps you to schedule your lessons, allowing you to be more prepared for lessons.

Adding on, ra.VI also allows you to keep track of your CAP, so that you can keep tabs on how well you are doing, motivating you towards that elusive CAP 5.0.

---

### How to use this Guide

This user guide will give you a step-by-guide tutorial on how to use each of the commands provided in ra.VI. To aid this, this guide is written with specific formatting to help you understand how to use ra.VI better.

`Grey highlighted font` like this indicate a command or a keyword. For example, `help` or `list -t`.

Keywords like `<day>` and `<lesson_type>` are surrounded by angle brackets ("<" and ">"), and they indicate the positions of extra information you need to provide to the command. For example, `add -m <module_code>` means that you need to fill in the module code you want in the place of the `<module_code>`. It would look something like `add -m CS2113T`.

We also have some special text boxes to help you understand how to use ra.VI!

```tip
This box shows you information that isn't necessary, but will be helpful.
```

```note
This box shows you useful information that you will need to know.
```

```warning
This box tells you about things you need to be alert about. If you're not careful, you might end up with an error!
```

---

### Keywords

#### Command-Line Interface

The Command-Line Interface (or CLI for short) is a type of user interface which lets a user control a computer program like ra.VI. Instead of the Graphical User Interface (GUI) with buttons and menus like you are probably used to, the CLI is entirely text-based. This makes it less intuitive but far faster to use, especially if you are a fast typer!

#### Tasks

A task refers to something that you would like to get done. This refers to reading a book or doing an assignment. Tasks can be created with or without a deadline.

#### Deadline

A deadline refers to a date and time associated with a task. This is in the format: `DAY-MONTH-YEAR TIME_24H`, e.g. `23-12-2020 1400` or `1-2-2000 0800`.

#### Modules

A module refers to a module taken under NUS. Entered modules will be checked against the list of NUS modules taken from [NUSMods](https://nusmods.com/timetable/sem-1).

#### Module Code

A module code refers to the **official** module code of the module you are trying to refer to. As with modules, ra.VI will be taking reference from [NUSMods](https://nusmods.com/timetable/sem-1).

#### CAP

CAP refers to Cumulative Average Point, which is the [grading system used by NUS](http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/academic-information-policies/graduate/modular-system). The CAP will be calculated based on your modules and the grades you have assigned to them.

#### Done

Any task can be marked as “done”. This will signify completion of the task so that you can get an easy view of any remaining tasks.

#### Timetable

The timetable holds all the lessons you take. It allows you to manage the lessons for the modules that you are taking.

#### NUS Week Number

NUS’s semesters last for 6 weeks, followed by Recess Week, then another 6 weeks, and finally Reading Week for a total of 14 weeks. When you first use ra.VI, you will be asked to tell ra.VI the current NUS week number. After setting the timetable up the first time, you do not need to go through the set up again.

#### Lesson Type

Some commands have a `lesson_type` field for you to specify a certain type of lesson. Here are the accepted values:\
`TUTORIAL`, `LECTURE`, `SEMINAR`, `LAB`, `RECITATION`, `SESSION`.

```warning
Similar to the `day` field, this format must be followed exactly! It has to be fully spelled out as shown here, and entirely in uppercase.
```

#### Repeat

`repeat` is a field to specify how often lessons should repeat.
* `0` - Does not repeat.
* `1` - Repeats every week.
* `2` - Repeats every **even** week.
* `3` - Repeats every **odd** week.

#### Day

Some commands have a `day` field for you to specify a certain day. Here are the accepted values:\
`MONDAY`, `TUESDAY`, `WEDNESDAY`, `THURSDAY`, `FRIDAY`, `SATURDAY`, `SUNDAY`.

```warning
This format must be followed exactly! Fully spelled out in uppercase. `Monday`, `Mon`, `monday` are examples of what will **not** work. If you want to specify Monday, only `MONDAY` will work.
```

#### Time

Some commands require you to enter a time. The `time` field requires the hours and minutes of the time you want to specify, in the [24H format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock). For example, 9AM would be `0900` and 2:15PM would be `1415`.

#### Deadline

Some commands require you to enter a date and time for a deadline. The date portion should have the day, month, and year written in numbers and separated with dashes.

For example, 30 December 2020 would be `30-12-2020`. The time portion is the same as described in the [Time](#time) explanation above. A full deadline of “15 February 2021 3:30AM” would be `15-02-2021 0330`.

#### Undo

Some commands edit your tasks, modules, and lessons. All commands that edit your information can be undone! Here’s a list:
* Adding / deleting / editing tasks.
* Completing tasks.
* Adding / deleting / editing modules.
* Adding / deleting / editing lessons to / from the timetable.
* Resetting the timetable.
* Grading a module.

### ra.VI’s Interface

![Interface with arrows and labels](images/interface/1.png)

ra.VI is a CLI application, which means you control it entirely with text commands. This is the start screen of ra.VI, after you've used it at least once and initialised ra.VI with the current NUS week number. ra.VI shows you the loading statuses of your data in the welcome message. Your data can either be successfully loaded, skipped (if you have no data), or corrupted if something is wrong with the file.

```note
All your data is saved in the `data` folder that will be created when ra.VI first runs! There will be 4 save files:
* `mod_data.json`
* `task_data.json`
* `timetable_data.json`
* `nus_mod_data.json`

If any of these files are corrupted (unreadable by ra.VI), ra.VI will rename them with a ".bak" at the end to indicate that it is no longer in use as a save file. For example, "mod_data.json" would become "mod_data.json.bak".
```

![Initialisation interface with arrows and labels](images/interface/2.png)

This is what you should first see when you launch ra.VI. As you can see from the picture, all the data files' statuses are "skipped" since you have no data saved. It's your first time using ra.VI after all! ra.VI also tells you that it has downloaded the latest data from NUSMods to provide you with useful module information.

![Command prompt interface explanation](images/interface/3.png)

ra.VI will “talk” to you with lines of text, as you can see from the diagram. Your previous command entered will be shown on top of the **output** (the result) for that command. You will always be able to type in the next command at the bottom of the window, as shown in the image.

Just type in whatever command you wish to use with the appropriate syntax and press the Enter key. It's really that simple!

---

## Quick Start

New to using ra.VI? Here's how to get ra.VI up and functional in a few simple steps.

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
2. Download the latest version of `ra.VI` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T09-2/tp/releases/tag/v2.1).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for `ra.VI`.\
![Jar file in folder](images/quickstart/1.png){:height="50%" width="50%"}
4. Use your terminal of choice (like Command Prompt or Powershell on Windows, or Terminal on macOS) in the folder from step 3 and enter `java -jar ravi.jar`.\
![Console with start jar command](images/quickstart/2.png)
5. ra.VI will be launched, and you will be greeted with the welcome screen!\
![Welcome screen](images/quickstart/3.png)
6. Enter the current NUS week number as prompted. You will then see the prompt for your command.\
![Command Prompt](images/quickstart/4.png)
7. Type the command in the command prompt and press the Enter key to execute it.
  1. For example, typing `help` and pressing the Enter key will show you the help message, with a list of all of ra.VI’s commands.
8. Refer to the Features below for details of each command, or refer to the command summary for a quick look at all possible commands.

```warning
It is highly recommended that you have a working internet connection when you first launch ra.VI, as ra.vI will try to download the latest data from NUSMods the first time you use it. If it is not possible, ra.VI has some backup NUSMods data that it can use that is bundled with it, but it may be prone to inaccuracies as it cannot be updated as frequently.
```

### Timetable
Every NUS student has lessons to take, whether they are lectures, labs or tutorials, just to name a few. These lessons are usually at regular intervals throughout the semester. ra.VI will help you arrange your lessons into a timetable, allowing you to view all of your lessons in one place.

#### Adding a lesson (Jun You)
Every student has lessons. Too many lessons, even. Let ra.VI help you keep track of them all with this command.

**Format:**
`timetable -add <module_code> <day> <start_time> <end_time> <lesson_type> <repeat>`

```warning
These fields must follow this order strictly, and also must follow certain requirements. You can check the [Keywords](#keywords) section above for details on these fields!

For `module_code`, the module code must be in your module list. See your module list with `list -m`.

The format for `start_time` and `end_time` are both explained in the "Time" section of the [Keywords](#keywords) section above. `start_time` must be chronologically before `end_time`. For example, `1800 1700` is not accepted, but `1700 1800` is accepted.
```

**Example Usage:**
Let’s say you have a lecture for CS2101 at 8AM to 10AM on every Tuesday, and you would like to add it to your timetable.
To add a lesson to your timetable:
1. Type `timetable -add`, followed by the lesson’s details, `CS2101 TUESDAY 0800 1000 LECTURE 1`.
2. The full command would be `timetable -add CS2101 TUESDAY 0800 1000 LECTURE 1`.
3. Then, simply press the Enter key to execute it.

**Outcome:**
ra.VI will display a message saying that your lesson has been added!

If you have a cluttered timetable and would only like to view certain lessons out of all of your lessons, ra.VI can filter them out for you.

**Format:**
`timetable -filter <module> <day> <start_time> <end_time> <lesson_type>`

**Example Usage:**
Let’s say that you want to see all your lessons on Thursday this week. To filter out these lessons from your timetable:
1. Type `timetable -filter`, followed by the lesson’s details, `- THURSDAY - - -`.
2. The full command would be `timetable -filter - THURSDAY - - -`.
3. Then, simply press the Enter key to execute it.

**Outcome:**
ra.VI will display a message saying that your lesson has been deleted.

```tip
Confused by the `-` symbol? If you want to skip using certain criteria, you can use a dash (`-`) in the place of that field! For example, if you only want to filter all lessons on Monday, you could do `timetable -filter - MONDAY - - -`, only filling in the `day` field and using `-` to ignore the other fields. **Any combination of fields is possible!**

Need help with the `<module> <day> <start_time> <end_time> <lesson_type>`? Refer to the [Keywords](#keywords) section to find out more!
```

**For some context,** here is the timetable without any filtering:

#### Resetting your timetable (Sean)
As you move to the next semester, you can still continue to use ra.VI. In fact, we would appreciate it if you could use ra.VI all the way until your graduation!

**Format:**
`timetable -reset`

**Example Usage:**
Let’s say that it is the start of a new semester and you would like to start with a new timetable.

To reset your timetable:
1. Type `timetable -reset`. That is the full command.
2. Then, simply press the Enter key to execute it.

**Outcome:**
ra.VI will prompt you for the current NUS week, just like when you used ra.VI for the first time. Once that is completed, ra.VI will display a message saying that your timetable has been reset.

```warning
Once you reset your timetable and exit ra.VI, there is no going back! You can only undo your timetable reset before you exit ra.VI, so do make sure that you truly want to reset your timetable and that you will not lose any valuable information.
```
