## 1 Setting up
The following section describes how to set up ra.VI on your own computer.

### 1.1 Software Prerequisites

1. **JDK** 11
2. **IntelliJ** IDEA

### 1.2 Setting up the work environment

1. **Fork** this repo onto your GitHub account. **Clone** it onto your computer.
2. Open IntelliJ. Close any existing projects if you are not at the welcome page.
3. Ensure it is set to the correct JDK version.
    a. `Configure` > `Project Structure for New Projects` > Select Java 11 under Project SDK.
4. Click `Open or Import` to open the cloned repo.
5. If necessary, locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click OK.

### 1.3 Verifying the setup

1. Run the program by selecting the `run` Gradle task at the top right and running it.
2. Test the program by trying to run commands.
3. Additionally, select the `test` Gradle task and run it. Check that all the tests pass.

### 1.4 Configure coding style

ra.VI's code uses the Gradle Checkstyle plugin.
It is advised to change [IntelliJ's built-in code style
options](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijCodeStyle.html) to match the requirements.

The checkstyle configurations is in `<ROOT>/config/checkstyle/` by default. Here is some information on [how to use the
Checkstyle plugin with IntelliJ IDEA](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/checkstyle.html).

## 2 Design

### 2.1 Architecture

#### 2.1.1 Main Classes and Main Command Loop

This is a class diagram of the top-level of ra.Vi.  
The classes depicted here are those which are direct dependencies of the main class `Ravi`.  
The various dependencies of the classes depicted here are not shown to avoid cluttering, and are described in later
sections.

![UML class diagram for Main Class](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/docs/diagrams/MainClassDiagram.png?raw=true)

The main class holds the main loop. 
Most classes used by the main class are static in nature and do not need to be instantiated. 

`Executor` can be viewed as a simple layer of abstraction on top of `Command`, `CommandResult`, `StateManager`,
`TimeTableManager`, `InputOutputManager` to facilitate the execution of user commands, while reducing the dependencies
of the main class. `Command` is a dependency of `Parser` as `Parser` creates `Command` objects to return to the main
loop.

![Sequence diagram 1 for Main loop](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/docs/diagrams/MainSequenceDiagram.png?raw=true)

This sequence diagram shows the activity of the main class, `Ravi`. When it starts, it first adds the shutdown hook to
handle both unexpected and normal shutdowns.

`start()` and `runCommandLoopUntilExitCommand()` are referenced in sequence diagrams below.

Following that, `Ravi` calls the `run()` function, which is just a wrapper for the two methods `start()` and
`runCommandLoopUntilExitCommand()`. `start()` may throw an exception while trying to load the NUSMods data; if it cannot
load the NUSMods data, `run()` will show the error message to the user using `TextUi` then return
to `main()`, where `main()` terminates and ra.VI shuts down.

After `start()` runs successfully, `runCommandLoopUntilExitCommand()` will run until the user gives the exit command,
`bye`. Subsequently, `run()` will return, `main()` will terminate, and ra.VI shuts down.

The shutdown hook runs right before ra.VI shuts down (i.e. when `main()` terminates or when the process is shut down via
any other means other than `SIGKILL`). It prints a shutdown message as described in the diagram to assure the user that
their data is saved.

![Sequence diagram 2 for Main loop](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/docs/diagrams/MainSequenceDiagramStartSd.png?raw=true)

This sequence diagram holds the reference for `start()`.

`TextUi` is initialised with a new `Scanner` object set to `System.in` to get user input.

`InputOutputManager` is initialised, which makes it load all user data files and NUSMods data. It will return the
results of the load (i.e. success or failure) which will be displayed by `TextUi` later on. As mentioned earlier, if
it fails to load NUSMods data (when resource file is corrupted and there is no Internet connection), it will throw an
exception so that ra.VI terminates.

`StateManager` is initialised, creating the empty stacks of 'snapshots' as well as pushing the first snapshot (which is
the starting state) to the stack.

`TimeTableManager` is initialised. The user is required to input the **current NUS week**.
* If it is currently before or exactly Week 6 of the semester, the user should input the actual week number.
* If it's currently recess week, the user should input "7".
* If it's currently after recess week, the user should input the current week number plus one (to account for
recess week).
There is a validation loop to catch invalid user input.

![Sequence diagram 3 for Main loop](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/docs/diagrams/MainSequenceDiagramLoopSd.png?raw=true)

The main loop is contained in the `runCommandLoopUntilExitCommand()` method.
The main loop follows the following steps:
1. Get the user input as a string.
2. Send the user input to `Executor`.
2. `Executor` parses the input using `Parser` and gets a `Command` object.
3. It then executes the `Command` object with the `execute()` method. This will do the necessary work and return a
`CommandResult` object.
4. If any data was changed, `Executor` runs `StateManager`'s `saveState()` to facilitate undo commands, and
`InputOutputManager`'s `save()` to save all user data as a measure against unexpected shutdowns.
5. Finally, use the `CommandResult` object to show the result of the `Command` to the user using `TextUi`.

> :exclamation: Note that the `Executor` class wraps the `InputOutputManager` class

#### 2.1.2 Command Family

The Command family of classes are nearly all derived from the abstract `Command` class, except for
`CommandResult` and `PromptType`. All `Command` classes belong to the `Command` package. This is shown in the diagram
below.

![UML class diagram for Command Family Classes](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/docs/diagrams/CommandClassDiagram.png?raw=true)

`PromptType` indicates the functionality of the `Command` object. The most useful type is `EDIT`, which indicates to
StateManager that there has been a change in state.

The `Command` classes carry information about the user's command. There is one class for each exact user command. The
`execute()` function of the `Command` class generates a `CommandResult`, which holds the reply to the user. This is
shown in the diagram below.

![UML sequence diagram for Command Classes](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/docs/diagrams/CommandSequenceDiagram.png?raw=true)

#### 2.1.3 Data Family

The Data family of classes consists of all the abstracted data types required for our features, such as
`Task`, `Module`, and their respective Managers. All Data classes exist in the `data` package, and the classes
in charge of saving and loading like `InputOutputManager` are in the storage subpackage.

![UML class diagram for Data Family Classes](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/docs/diagrams/DataClassDiagram.png?raw=true)

`Lesson`, `Task`, and `Module` are the base level abstractions, with their respective Managers containing the logic
to store and manipulate instances of these objects in a meaningful way. `InputOutputManager` reads and writes
information from the various Managers in order to save and load. `State` and `StateManager` are specifically for undo
functionality. They do not interact directly with the rest of the Data family.

`LessonFilter` is the only interface in the data package. It allows for flexible creation of filters for powerful user
filtering of lessons via lambda functions. For example, the user can choose to filter only lectures on Mondays before
2PM.

Since there is no `Command` to save or load, `InputOutputManager` is not a dependency of `Command`. All the other
Managers, however, are dependencies of `Command` as there are commands for using/manipulating each one of them.
`InputOutputManager` and `Command` are then dependencies of the main class `Ravi`.

ra.VI loads the user saves granularly to prevent any errors in loading one file from affecting the rest. The full
sequence diagram is below, separated into three sections.

![UML sequence diagram for Loading Data](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/docs/diagrams/DataSequenceDiagram.png?raw=true)

The above is the main loading diagram. ra.VI tries to load each save file separately. The tasks, modules, and timetable
save files are handled in the same way. The NUSMods save file is handled in a different way as it is possible to load
from the NUSMods API or the prepackaged NUSMods resource file in the JAR release.

![UML sequence diagram for Loading Data (Normal data)](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/docs/diagrams/DataSequenceDiagramDataSd.png?raw=true)

`InputOutputManager` uses the `File` and `Decoder` classes to read from the file and decode the contents into the data
objects (using FastJSON). Depending on whether the file exists or whether exceptions are thrown, the status code is
updated and returned accordingly.

> :exclamation: The data classes may have seemingly unused getters and setters. This is intended, as FastJSON needs
> them to be present in order to handle the conversion between JSON strings and Java objects.

![UML sequence diagram for Loading Data (NUSMods)](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/docs/diagrams/DataSequenceDiagramNusModsSd.png?raw=true)

For NUSMods, the same principles apply. However, there is a chain of try-catch blocks to serve as fallbacks if one
loading measure fails.

1. Try to load from the data directory. The NUSMods data is saved in the data directory to serve as a cached, most
up-to-date version of the data for faster and more accurate data.
2. Failing that, try to load from the NUSMods API. This is slightly slower and requries the user to have an internet
access.
3. Failing both of the above, try to load from the JAR resource file. The JAR release will hold a version of the
NUSMods data that we stored in case of these situations. This version may be out of date, however, but it's the next
best option available.
4. Failing all the above, `InputOutputManager` will throw an exception that causes ra.VI to shut down. There will be
a message prompting the user to re-download the JAR release if they can do so, as it is likely that the JAR file is 
corrupted in some way.

#### 2.1.4 Parser Family

The Parser family of classes consists of the main `Parser` class and the `xCommandParser` subclasses. The main `Parser` class
first determines the main `Command` in the user `Command` string. If it is one of the 10 commands with a `xCommandParser`
subclass, then `Parser` delegates the remaining work to the subclass due to the complicated logic involved. Otherwise, it
handles the logic itself.

**Parser "subclasses" do not inherit from the `Parser` class.** They serve to organise the code that would otherwise all
be placed in the `Parser` class.

`Parser` will create a `Command` object, no matter whether the user `Command` is valid or not (if it is not, then an
`IncorrectCommand` object is created). This `Command` object passes back to the main class `Ravi` for execution.

![UML class diagram for Parser Family Classes](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/docs/diagrams/ParserClassDiagram.png?raw=true)

#### 2.1.5 Timetable Family 

The Timetable Family of classes is an example of a _cross-family_ family of classes from the `Data` and `Command`
families, and consists of the `TimeTableCommand` and `TimeTableCommandParser` classes, as well as `TimeTableManager` and
`TimeTable` themselves. Extending from the abstract `TimeTableCommand` class are the `TimeTableAddCommand`,
`TimeTableDeleteCommand`, `TimeTableViewCommand`, and `TimeTableResetCommand` classes.

![Class diagram for TimeTable Family Classes](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/docs/diagrams/TimeTableClassDiagram.png?raw=true)

**This is a good representation of how the other data classes (`Task`, `Module`) work as well.** The `Command` objects
call the methods held in the Manager classes to perform work on the stored user data. There are the classic getters and
setters, as well as more elaborate adding, deleting, editing, and viewing methods with logic for validation.

Upon the first start up of ra.VI, `TimeTableManager.initialise()` will be run. This will no longer run again in future
sessions as long as the user does not tamper with or delete the files in the created data folder, or use ra.VI elsewhere.

The `TimeTable` is created based on the user's initial input, with an appropriate number of `LessonManagers`.
The point of entry for this feature will be at `TimeTableCommandParser`, which will decide which of the commands 
to return through `parseTimeTableCommand()`. If the `TimeTableCommand` is returned and executed, the 
`TimeTableManager` will carry out the associated commands, adding, deleting or viewing the lessons in the timetable.

### 2.2 Implementation

This section serves to **provide an overview of how certain features are implemented**, not provide a comprehensive
explanation of all features in ra.VI.

#### 2.2.1 Add/Delete Feature

This feature is facilitated by the `TaskManager`, `ModuleManager` classes.
Extending from the abstract `Command` class are the `AddModuleCommand` and `AddTaskCommand` classes. This feature implements
the following operations:
* Add tasks - Add a task to the task list through `TaskManager.add()`
* Add modules - Add a module to the module list through `ModuleManager.add()`
* Delete tasks - Deletes a task from the task list through `TaskManager.delete()`
* Delete modules - Deletes a module from the module list through `ModuleManager.delete()`

![Sequence diagram for AddCommand](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/docs/diagrams/AddCommandSequenceDiagram.png?raw=true)

As seen from the sequence diagram above, this is the flow of an add command. This flow is similar to that of a delete command with the naming being the only difference.\
`AddCommand` is an abstract class, inheriting from it are `AddTaskCommand` and `AddModuleCommand`.\
The `AddCommandParser` decides to create either `AddModuleCommand`, `AddTaskCommand` or `IncorrectCommand` objects
based on the user input.\
Each of these have an `execute()` function that creates a `CommandResult` object that shows the user the result of
the `Command` through `TextUi`, using `showOutputToUser()`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add feature behaves at each step.

1. The user launches the application for the first time.

2. The user inputs `add -m CS2101` into ra.VI, as the user wants to note down a module named ‘CS2101’ and add it to their module list.\
`TextUi` receives the input as a string. `Parser` and `AddCommandParser` parse the string before creating an `AddModuleCommand`. 

3. The `AddModuleCommand` is executed, returning a `CommandResult` containing a success message if the module has been successfully added.\
Otherwise, an exception message will be shown explaining the exception to the user.\
Common reasons for failure include:

* Wrong command format\
e.g. `add --t task`\
e.g. `add -t task --by 2-10-2020 1400`\
e.g. `add -m Fake Mod`\
e.g. `add -t task -by 2nd Jan`
* Module already exists in module list\
e.g. `add -m CS1010` but the module list already contains `CS1010`

#### 2.2.2 List Feature

This feature is facilitated by the `TaskManager` and `ModuleManager` classes.  
It extends from the abstract `Command` class.  
This feature implements the following operations:
* List tasks - List all tasks in the task list through `TaskManager.list()`
* List modules - List all modules in the module map through `ModuleManager.list()`

![Sequence diagram for List Feature in Command class](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/docs/diagrams/ListCommandSequenceDiagram.png?raw=true)

As seen from the sequence diagram above, this is the flow of `ListCommand`.  
`ListCommandParser` class calls `ListCommand(1)`, `ListCommand(0)`, or throws an `InvalidParameterException()`
based on the user input.

`ListCommand` has an `execute()` method. Depending on the type of entry, `ListCommand` calls `list()` method of
`TaskManager` if it is "TASK", or `list()` method of `ModuleManager` if it is "MODULE".

If output is null, `ListCommand` calls `CommandResult(MESSAGE_LIST_EMPTY)`, creating a `CommandResult` object.
Else, `ListCommand` calls `CommandResult(MESSAGE_LIST_PRINTED + output)`, creating a `CommandResult` object.

`ListCommand` returns `CommandResult`. 

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the list feature behaves at each step.  
1. The user launches the application for the first time.  
2. The user inputs `add -t Read book` into ra.VI, adding the task to the task list in TaskManager. The user keys in
multiple other tasks of the following:
* `add -t Return book -by 2-10-2020 1400`
* `add -t Meeting`  

3. The user inputs `add -m CS2113T` into ra.VI, adding the module to the module map in ModuleManager. The user keys in
multiple other modules of the following:
* `add -m CS2101`
* `add -m CG2271`

4. The user inputs `list -t`. The `CommandResult` returns  
```
Here's your list:

1. return a book [x]
2. read a book [x], by 07:00PM, Sunday, 02 Feb 2020
```
5. The user inputs `list -m`. The `CommandResult` returns  
```
Here's your list:

1. CS1010: Programming Methodology (0.0MC) (Grade: No grade yet)
2. CS3235: Computer Security (0.0MC) (Grade: No grade yet)
```

#### 2.2.3 CAP Feature 
This feature is facilitated by `ModuleManager` and `Module` class
It extends `Command` and runs through the `ModuleManager`, checking every `Module`'s grade and module credit.
* Calculate user's CAP - Uses a formula to calculate the user's current cap.

![Sequence diagram for Cap Feature in Command class](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/docs/diagrams/CapCommandSequenceDiagram.png?raw=true)

As seen from the sequence diagram above, this is the flow of a CAP command.
The `CapCommandParser` parses the user's input and calls the `CapCommand` constructor.
When `CapCommand` executes, a `CommandResult` object is created that calculates the user's current cap after taking into 
account the user's current modules and the users's total MC taken based on the modules graded.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the CAP feature behaves at each step. 

1. The user launches the application for the first time. 

2. The user inputs `add -m CS2101` into ra.VI, as the user adds a module they are taking into the `ModuleManager`.
The user keys in as many modules into ra.VI as they are taking. 

3. Once the user attains a grade for the modules keyed in, they input `grade CS2101 4 A-` (4 MCs, A grade) to record the
grade for their module. They does this for all the other modules they have taken.

4. Once every module in the `ModuleManager` has been graded, they inputs `cap` to calculate their accumulative 
CAP after attaining their new grades.

5. The `CommandResult` returns the success message to show the user their current CAP after attaining their grades.

#### 2.2.4 Grade Feature 
This feature is facilitated by `ModuleManager` and `Module` classes. 
It extends `Command` and is stored internally inside `Module` as a `grade` and `moduleCredit`.
* Grading a module - assigns a grade and MC number to a specific module present in the module list.

![Sequence diagram for Grade Feature in Command class](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/docs/diagrams/GradeCommandSequenceDiagram.png?raw=true)

As seen from the sequence diagram above, this is the flow of a Grade command.
The `GradeCommandParser` parses the user's input, and assigns the relevant attributes in the `GradeCommand` constructor,
such as `moduleCredit` and `grade`. When `GradeCommand` executes,a `CommandResult` object is created that shows
the user the result of the `Command` through `TextUi`, using `showOutputToUser()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the grade feature behaves at each step.

1. The user launches the application. The user inputs `add -m CS2101` into ra.VI, as the user wants to note down 
a module named ‘CS2101’ and add it to their module list.

2. The user inputs `grade CS2101 4 A+`. The `Parser` parses and allocates the user input to `GradeCommand`. 
`GradeCommand.execute()` is called and `ModuleManager` checks if such a module exists in the user’s module list, 
then checks if the input grade is valid according to the NUS grading schematic. Finally, it assigns the specific module
with the grade and module credits.

3. The `CommandResult` returns the success message to show the user that their module has successfully been graded. 
Otherwise, an exception message will be shown regarding the exception caught.

#### 2.2.5 Undo Feature
This feature is facilitated by `State` and `StateManager` classes. 

* `GradeCommand.testgrade(stringGrade)` - checks if the input grade is valid according to NUS grading schematic 
* `GradeCommand.grade(moduleModule)` - assigns the specific module present in the module list, the grade and moduleCredit attributes.

![Sequence diagram for Undo Feature](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/docs/diagrams/UndoCommandSequenceDiagram.png?raw=true)

As seen from the sequence diagram above, this is the flow of an Undo command.
The Parser parses the user's input, and construct the default UndoCommand.
When the Undo Command object executes, the `undo()` method in the StateManager class will be called.
In the StateManager, the previous copies of the data are encoded as Json and stored in a stack.
When the `undo()` is called, the StateManager will pops the top copy in the stack. 
After that, the StateManager class will notify TaskManager and Module Manager to load from the encoded saved copies. To do that, it will facilitate the load methods, `loadMods()` `loadTasks()` from TaskManager and ModuleManager to set the data.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo feature behaves at each step.

1. The user launches the application. The user inputs `add -m CS2101` into ra.VI, as the user wants to note down 
a module named ‘CS2101’ and add it to their module list. This input is received by the Ui ,which processes it into 
a string. The parser parses the string and allocates it to the AddCommand where it is added to the list of modules. 

2. The user finds the module just added is wrong. Thus, he wants to undo the previous `add -m CS2101` command.

3. The user inputs `undo` into ra.VI. The input is received by the Ui, which then passes the input to Parser and parsed to an Undo command.

4. Then the execution process of the Undo command will makes the method calls demonstrate above in the diagram. 

5. More importantly, the Undo command only works for those 'data-changed' operations. Those operations refer to 'add', 'delete', 'edit' commands.

#### 2.2.6 Timetable Feature

This feature is facilitated by the `TimeTableManager` class and `TimeTableCommand` class.
Extending from the abstract `TimeTableCommand` class are the `TimeTableAddCommand`, `TimeTableDeleteCommand`,
`TimeTableViewCommand` and `TimeTableResetCommand` classes.
* Add a lesson - Add a lesson to the timetable through `TimeTableManager.addLesson()`
* Delete a lesson - Delete all associated lessons from the timetable through `TimeTableManager.deleteLesson()`
* View today's timetable - List all lessons for today through `TimeTableManager.getSpecificDayLessons()`
* View this week's timetable - List all lessons in this week through `TimeTableManager.getSpecifiedWeekLessons()`
* Reset timetable - Reset the whole timetable through `TimeTableManager.initialiseTimetable()` 

##### 2.2.6.1 Add lesson/s to timetable

Given below is an example scenario to add a lesson to the timetable and how the timetable feature behaves at each step.

1. The user launches the application for the first time. ra.VI asks for the current NUS week. This input is parsed and 
initialises the `TimeTableManager`. 

2. The user inputs `add -m CS2101`, as the user wants to note down a module named `CS2101` and add it to their module list.

3. The user inputs `timetable -add CS2101 TUESDAY 0800 1000 LECTURE 1`. This means the user wants to add a `CS2101 LECTURE` 
that occurs once a week on `TUESDAY 0800 1000`. This `Command` will be parsed and eventually returns a `TimeTableAddCommand`.

4. The `TimeTableAddCommand` is executed, returning a `CommandResult` containing a success message if the lesson has 
been successfully added. Otherwise, an exception message will be shown explaining the exception to the user.\
Common reasons for failure include:

* Wrong command format\
e.g. `timetable -add CS2101 TUE 0800 1000 LECTURE 1`\
e.g. `timetable -add CS2101 TUESDAY 8am 10am LECTURE 1`\
e.g. `timetable -add CS2101 TUESDAY 0800 1000 NONSENSE 1`\
e.g. `timetable -add CS2101 TUESDAY 0800 1000 LECTURE 5`
* Module does not exist in module list\
e.g. `timetable -add CS2101 TUESDAY 0800 1000 LECTURE 1` but the module list does not contain `CS2101`. Available modules can be found by entering `list -m`
e.g. `timetable -add BAD TUESDAY 0800 1000 LECTURE 1` but the module list does not contain `BAD` and `BAD` is not a valid NUS module.

##### 2.2.6.2 Delete lesson/s from timetable

Given below is an example scenario to delete a lesson from the timetable and how the timetable feature behaves at each step.

1. The user launches the application for the first time. ra.VI asks for the current NUS week. This input is parsed 
and initialises the `TimeTableManager`. 

2. The user inputs `add -m CS2101`, as the user wants to note down a module named `CS2101` and add it to their module list.

3. The user inputs `timetable -add CS2101 TUESDAY 0800 1000 LECTURE 1`. This means the user wants to add a 
`CS2101 LECTURE` that occurs once a week on `TUESDAY 0800 1000`. This `Command` will be parsed and eventually returns a 
`TimeTableAddCommand`.

4. The user inputs `timetable -del TUESDAY 1`. This means the user wants to delete the `CS2101 TUESDAY 0800 1000 LECTURE` 
lessons. The `1` at the end reflects lessons on index `1` on `TUESDAY` as reflected by `timetable -day` or `timetable -week`. 
This `Command` will be parsed and eventually returns a `TimeTableDeleteCommand`.

5. The `TimeTableDeleteCommand` is executed, returning a `CommandResult` containing a success message if the lessons 
have been successfully deleted. Otherwise, an exception message will be shown explaining the exception to the user.
Common reasons for failure include:

* Wrong Command format\
e.g. `timetable -del TUE 1`.
* Lesson does not exist in the timetable\
e.g. `timetable -del TUESDAY 5` but the timetable does not contain a lesson/s on `TUESDAY` at index `5`. Current 
lessons can be found by entering `timetable -day` or `timetable -week`.

##### 2.2.6.3 View the timetable

Given below is an example scenario to view the timetable for the day.

1. The user adds a lesson to the timetable for today, for e.g. `timetable -add CS2101 TUESDAY 0800 1000 LECTURE 1`.

2. The user inputs `timetable -day`.

3. The timetable for the day is shown to the user. The user is able to see the Tuesday CS2101 lecture that was 
previously added in step 1.

##### 2.2.6.4 Filter the timetable

Given below is an example scenario to filter the timetable for CS2101 LECTURE.

1. The user adds a lesson to the timetable for today, for e.g. `timetable -add CS2101 TUESDAY 0800 1000 LECTURE 1`.

2. The user inputs `timetable -filter CS2101 - - - LECTURE`

3. All CS2101 lectures in the timetable are shown to the user. The user is able to see the CS2101 weekly lectures that were previously added in step 1.

* Wrong Command format\
e.g. `timetable -filter`

##### 2.2.6.5 Reset the timetable

Given below is an example scenario to reset the timetable. 

1. The user inputs `timetable -reset`.  

2. ra.VI will ask for the current NUS week. This input is parsed and re-initialises the `TimeTableManager` with a new `Timetable`.

#### 2.2.8 Colored Output
The output of ra.VI is colored to improve readability and draw attention to important parts of messages. To color
ra.VI's output, we used the [JANSI library](https://github.com/fusesource/jansi) which uses ANSI escape codes to color
printed messages on the terminal. As ANSI escape codes are universally supported on most terminals, we do not foresee
major compatibility issues with the mainstream OSes.

We use JANSI's `ansi().render()` to wrap ra.VI's output in `TextUi`'s `outputToUser` function. So, we gain the ability
to color (and otherwise decorate) ra.VI's text using JANSI's formatting standards.

An example: To make `"Hello"` red, we change it to `"@|red Hello|@"`.

> :exclamation: The extra characters cause some difficulties in centering text, so `centerString(String s)` in
> `TextHelper` is designed to remove these formatting artifacts and center the text properly. However,
> `centerString(int width, String s)` does not remove the JANSI artifacts and hence should not be used with JANSI.

## 3 Appendix A: Product scope
### 3.1 Target user profile

The target user profile for ra.VI is described by the following:
* A student of NUS (a freshman in particular).
* Has a need to manage their school related tasks, classes and notes.
* Prefers desktop apps over other types.
* Types fast.
* Prefers typing to mouse interactions.
* Reasonably comfortable using CLI apps.

### 3.2 Value proposition

A common problem amongst freshmen is the inability to organise all the incoming information.  
NUS places a focus on taking responsibility for your own learning, so it might be a tough transition from tertiary education.  
A lot of students miss lessons, assignments, and even exams, just because they're struggling to adapt to the new
environment.

ra.VI helps students to manage their school-related information in a compact, stripped-down interface that does not
bombard them with too much information.  
When you receive your modules and lessons, simply enter them into ra.VI as they arrive. ra.VI will keep track of all of it
for you.  
You can create tasks, give them deadlines, and tag them to certain modules. You can see all of your tasks and deadlines at a glance.  
You can even write and save your notes in ra.VI, uncluttering your work environment even further.

ra.VI is even integrated with NUSMods, bringing its comprehensive library of information to your fingertips.  
All the above features are wrapped in a compact, no-frills command-line interface. No confusing menus and dropdowns
to distract you; only simple commands to give you what you want.

#### 7.4.1 Amending the timetable
1. Adding a lesson
    1. Test case: `timetable -add CS2113T MONDAY 1200 1400 LECTURE 0` where `CS2113T` is a module in module list.\
    Expected: The TimeTableCommandParser parses the lesson parameters, `CS2113T` is the associated module, 
    `MONDAY 1200 1400 LECTURE` reflects that the lesson is a lecture on Monday from 12pm to 2pm. `0` indicates 
    that this lesson only occurs once. Since `CS2113T` is a valid module in the module list, the lesson will be added 
    to the timetable. Details of the success of the added lesson will be shown.
2. Deleting a lesson
    1. Test case: `timetable -del MONDAY 0` where the only lesson on MONDAY is a CS2113T lecture from 12pm to 2pm.\
    Expected: The TimeTableCommandParser parses the lesson parameters, and searches for a lesson/s of index `0` on 
    `MONDAY`. However, the timetable does not contain such lesson/s. Details of the associated error message will be shown.

#### 7.4.2 Viewing the timetable
1. Timetable for the day
    1. Test case: `timetable -day`\
    Expected: If there are no lessons for today, this information is shown to the user. Otherwise, the lessons for today 
    are shown to the user.
2. Timetable for the week
    1. Test case: `timetable -week`\
    Expected: The lessons for Monday to Sunday of this week are shown to the user.

#### 7.4.3 Filtering the timetable

    Expected: All CS2113T lessons are shown to the user.
    2. Test case: `timetable -filter CS2113T - - - LECTURE`, which filters CS2113T **lectures** only.\
    Expected: All CS2113T lectures are shown to the user.
    3. Test case: `timetable -filter CS2113T MONDAY 1200 2000 LECTURE`, which filters CS2113T lectures **on Monday 
    between 1200 and 2000** only.\
    Expected: All CS2113T lectures on Monday between 1200 and 2000 are shown to the user.

#### 7.4.4 Resetting the timetable
1. Reset the timetable
    1. Test case: `timetable -reset`\
    Expected: TimeTableManager clears and reinitialises the timetable. The user is prompted to input the current week for reinitialisation.

### 7.5 Calculating the Accumulated Cap after the current semester
1. Calculate the Cap:
    1. Test case: `cap`, where the modules in module list has already been graded individually.\
    Excepted: Each module in `ModuleManager` will be checked for its `moduleCredit` and `grade`.
    Using the CAP formula, the user's most updated CAP will be calculated and shown to user.

### 7.6 Grading an existing module in module list
1. Grade the module:
    1. Test case: `grade CS2101 4 A+`, where the module `CS2101` has been previously added to the module list.\
    Expected: Module `CS2101` will be checked if its inside ModuleManager.
    Since `CS2101` exists then the attributes of `4` and `A+` which are module credit and grade,
    will be added to the Module.  

### 7.7 Undo the previous command
**Do note that `undo` will only undo the last command that edited the data files, namely commands with a `PromptType` of `EDIT`.**
1. Undo:
    1. Test case: `undo`, after the user has input `add -t finish work`.\
    Expected: The task `finish work` is added to the task list. As the AddTaskCommand has a `PromptType` of `EDIT`, the addition of the task: `finish work` to the task list will be undone. Details of the successful undo will be shown.
    2. Test case: `undo`, without any prior commands with a `PromptType` of `EDIT` since the program launch.\
    Expected: Due to the fact that there have been no commands with a `PromptType` of `EDIT`, nothing will be undone and details of the associated error message will be shown.

### 7.8 Saving data
**Do note that if you exit the application without entering `bye`, ra.VI will still be able to retrieve data that was 
amended during that session. However, this is not a recommended way to use ra.VI.**\
**Tampering with the files created by ra.VI, through any other application, may also cause ra.VI to malfunction and is 
strongly discouraged.**
1. Add tasks and modules, then exit
    1. Test case: `add -t task 1`, `add -m CS1010`, `bye`\
    Expected: `user_task_data.json` and `user_mod_data.json` should be created in `<ROOT>/data/` with a JSON
    representation of the task and module.
2. Loading tasks and modules
    1. Test case: Run ra.VI again after the first test case, then run `list -t` and `list -m`.\
    Expected: `task 1` should be shown in the task list, and `CS1010` should be shown in the module list.

## The Graphical User Interface V3.0
**The graphical user interface and its related features are supposed to released in the next iteration v3.0**
**Thus, the GUI is currently still a separate branch. The professor asks me to attach the GUI features here to fulfill my contribution to the DG**
**The following are some features implemented in the GUI branch**

### Top level classes

This is a class diagram of the top-level of ra.Vi GUI version.  
The classes depicted here are those which are direct dependencies of the main class `Ravi`.  
The various dependencies of the classes depicted here are not shown to avoid cluttering, and are described in later
sections.

#### Command Family

The Command family of classes in GUI branch are regarded as the supplement for the master branch (CLI).
The Command family of classes are nearly all derived from the abstract `Command` class, except for
`CommandResult` and `PromptType`. All `Command` classes belong to the `Command` package. This is shown in the diagram
below.

#### Graphical User Interface Features
The graphical user interface is designed to help user to have a more intuitive concept of the modules and tasks.
The `MainStage` class implements the `Initializable` class. 
The DirectoryTree object is created when the `showDirectoryTree()` method is called in the `MainStage` class. 
The DailyTaskWindow object is created when the `showDailyTask()` method is called in the `MainStage` class.

### Feature explanation
#### General Add Feature
This feature is facilitated by the ModuleManager and TaskManager classes.
This is the general version of add feature. 
The Parser class will parse the general AddCommand to AddModuleCommand or AddTaskCommand  according to the user current level.
If the user is at the root level, the general AddCommand will be parsed to AddModuleCommand.
If the user is at the Module level, the general AddCommand will be parsed to AddTaskCommand.

#### Change directory Feature
This feature is facilitated by the `DirectoryTraverser` classes.  
It extends from the abstract `Command` class.  
This feature implements the following operations:
* Change to a specific directory (module/task) 
* Jump out of the the current directory (module/task)

Given below is an example scenario to show how the change directory feature behaves at each step.
Suppose the user is currently at the `root` level.
The user inputs cd `CS2113T`, to move to the module CS2113T directory.
The ChangeDirectoryCommand object will first examine if the user has specify the targeted directory.
If the user does not specify the target directory:
The method `findNextDirectory("CS2113T")` in DirectoryTraverse class will be called, to examine the validity of the userInput directory name `CS2113T`.
If the userInput directory name is valid, then the `traverseDown()` or `traverseUp()` method in the DirectoryTraverse class will be called.
If the userInput directory name is invalid, a `DataNotFoundException` will be thrown.
However, there is another boundary case, where the user tries to traverse beyond the boundary levels, such as the root level and task levels.
Then another exception `DirectoryTraversalOutOfBoundsException` will be thrown.
If the user like the example, has specified the directory CS2113T:
The `traverseTo(CS2113T)` method in the `DirectoryTraverse` class will be called to set the `currentDirectoryLevel` attribute to the specified the directory.

#### Week Command Feature
This feature works with the GUI components to create a upcoming week table for users. A window will pop out and the task number on the each day of the upcoming week will be listed.
It extends from the abstract `Command` class.  

#### Directory Command Feature
This feature works with the GUI components to create a module-list table for users. A window will pop out and all module with related tasks will be listed.
It extends from the abstract `Command` class.
